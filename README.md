# MongoDB_Notebook

### I am building another e-commerce app with the MEAN stack, and documenting every step carefully along the way. The purpose is to hone my skills and focus on software craftmanship. There will be extensive testing.
### The e-commerce app will also have a corresponding Ionic app.

####Use this as a notebook for your own applications if you'd like. It is based on the EdX course: (MongoDBx: M101x Introduction to MongoDB using the MEAN Stack)
####There are many sample/example files included as well to illustrate MongoDB.

###Dependencies: all you need to run is...
```npm install```
